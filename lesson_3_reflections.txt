When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When Im collaborating on a project with other people


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I can work on experimantal changes I am not ready to show to people yet 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch - something I change in the repository Im working on - other thingy
Clone - when I want to clone a repository of myself or some1 other
Forks - when I want to work on and make changes to repository I have no permissions to


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is useful, when you do not have internet access and you want to work on the project - on latest version of it
